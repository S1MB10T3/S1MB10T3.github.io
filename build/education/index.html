      “Top schools squander far too much of their technical talent on socially
      useless, high-paying pursuits like algorithmic trading. As Andrew Ng, a
      Stanford computer scientist, admonished a roomful of Stanford students he
      was trying to recruit to Coursera: ‘You have to ask yourself, why did I study
      computer science? And for a lot of students, the answer seems to be, so I can
      design the latest social media app...I believe we can build things that are
      more meaningful than that.’” <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/04/hey-computer-scientists-stop-hating-humanities/">(Wired)</a>

      Starting in high school, my first academic heavy experience with computer science was AP Computer Science. This class lacked people who really were passionate about computers. It lacked students in general. A room for 30 for a class registered for 20 with only 10 who actually showed up. But at least we had a robotics club for me to geek out about for a while.

      Now, coming to New York University, the computer science courses had the same void, not with the class numbers, but with the passion, especially in the clubs.

        “Academic freedom is subtly challenged by the constriction on free-ranging scholarly imagination and innovation entailed in the press for applied and commodifiable research, a press that sometimes openly contours the nature and findings of academic research... Indeed, academic freedom as we have known and protected Intervention it for decades in this country cannot survive in universities configured as corporations and reliant on corporate support: what private enterprise rewards, let alone tolerates, intellectual independence or public critique of its means and ends among its personnel?” - Wendy Brown, History of the Present

      I feel like a lot of students see Computer Science as a tool. Nothing is wrong with that and I view it as a pretty amazing tool too. The problem with that train of thought is we get graduates who only know how to use a tool but not know when and how to apply them. How can you help the world if you don't understand the world’s problems?

    I sometimes feel like I'm the crazy one at times, but just by going outside and talking to fellow CS students that randomly pop at events and such, I learn that I'm not alone with these thoughts. It's almost like there isn't a place for us to geek even in the classroom. As one of my friends would say, "We're going to bring culture back into CS."

    Could it be that we are all shy, introverted, and/or anti-social and the few
    who do have a passion for the study are over voiced by the vocal more corporate
    students? Maybe we are afraid of actually doing what we want in life do the consent need to work?
