      It’s important that we have access to a free and open Internet. Some could say that Internet should be a basic human right. As the Internet is woven into the daily lives of the western world. To some, having a working phone with an Internet connection can be more valuable then water.

      A democratically owned and decentralized Internet should be accessible to all. The internet is bound to a state or even a corporation. It belongs to us, the people. The internet and all it provides is beautiful only because we share our creations, ideas, hopes, and dreams. It allows us to build and work on solutions to problems.

  Luke Smith brings up a point that the freer a platform is, the more right-wing users there will be and the more censorship the left-wing users will be. Why is that? Luke Smith brings up an interesting observation I've noticed to that, sites that can afford more freedom tend to be more right leaning in nature and sites that have more censorship are more left by nature.

      “I think there are many people in anti-capitalist movements right now-I’m
      conscious of it because a bunch of them are showing up in New York Today-who
      actually can do that, who can say, ‘What we’re doing is arguing for a different
      kind of world. Go ahead, argue back. We’ll be in this argument with you.’
      But I think there’s still a tendency on the left, one that’s strong on the
      European left and on the old left and the old ‘New Left’ this country to,
      see truth as being on the side of the anti-capitalist forces, truth as being
      on the side of the left, rather than understanding a left position as a political
      argument that one wants to prevail in a moral-epistemological universe where
      no one has the Truth.” (Interview - Wendy Brown)

      For the decentralized Internet to become a viable option we on the left need
      to go out and have more open discussion with our opposition. The idea that
      we on the left know all the right answers is ridiculous. We don't and shouldn't
      have to silence our opposition. If we really did believe that we had all the
      answers, then we should have more open dicussions.

    To use fearless speach is to use parrhessia.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    Michel Foucault introduces the fearless speech as the Greek's parrhesia, which is to tell the truth even and especially if it differs from the majority’s truth. The speaker who takes part in parrhesia doesn't try to use persuasion or self-interest. Parrhesia can be only done if the speaker is frank with their listeners. It's the speaker’s moral duty to announce the truth to the public.
