A large modular flower pot. Individuals blocks working together to support life. A home for me isnâ€™t complete without veggies and plants around. Having a large pot that I can shift and resize provide a sense of comfort that I can always have a place to grow something.

_Photo above is a picture taken at A Place From Home art show at St Dymphna's, a bar in the East Village NYC._

Constructed out of wood, steel, and canvas.
