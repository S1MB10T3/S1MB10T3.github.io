    <h2> It's something... </h2>
    <p>
      cozy.nyc is a ongoing project me, <a href="https://github.com/JimenezJC">Juan Jimenez</a>,
      and <a href="https://github.com/nobodyhere2see">Sophia Setsu</a> are working
      on mainly to build our web development skills. The site oranigaally was to
      be an econmerce site to buy and sell clothing, but has changed over time to
      be more of a, for a lack of a better term, social media site for creatives,
      makers, and fans alike to discuss and share their and others works.

      <br />
      <br />

      Currently the features we working on are a messaging board "Boards" and a
      video streaming directory "Streams". "Works", which is a where users can post
      they're ongoing and/or finished projects.

    <h2>Stay Cozy...</h2>
    <p>
      Why the name cozy... Well when we first started on the project (when we
      planned it to be a ecommerce site) Cozy Tapes by A$AP MOB was out during
      the time.

    <h2>Dosis</h2>
    <p>
      Why Dosis... Dosis is a rounded san-serif font. When thinking about creating
      the site to invoke a warm and playful atmosphere. Dosis extra bold fits well
      with the astitcs and the rounded nature of the logo, the cozy cube.

    <p>
      Why cubes... When thinking about the design of the cube, we wanted to have
      a logo that could be converted to a physical object. A cube is a verstial
      and simple shape to produce on many mediums.

      Having the one side with the letter C is a play on the idea that cozy content
      is consumed on a digital box of some sort like a computer monitor or a phone
      screen.
