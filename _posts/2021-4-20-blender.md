I need to go through the basics. Kinda released since I’ve been using blender to build stuff I need for class or an art piece, I have never sat down and practiced this software.

I felt that most of my skills I’ve learned/honed have been through building something I want to create first, but in reality I’ve always been taught general skills of different mediums through a professor/teacher in school and have always prototype and played around with materials before working on the main goal.

Blender is different. It feels like an art tool in the real world but because the application can do so much and while I had professors for 3D graphics and design, I have never been taught how to use Blender and all the tools it provides me.

I should get to the basics and start recreating house objects like mugs, pans, shoes, and devices.
