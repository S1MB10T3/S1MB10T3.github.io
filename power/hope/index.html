      Wendy Brown discuses courageous speaking as a way to seek change or discussion. In a way, the same can be applied to using and promoting open source software. Through my years at NYU I’ve convinced my CS friends to install GNU/Linux and have involved others interested in the prospect of using Linux.</p>

      The open source community needs more than just programmers and tinkerers. We need the whole spectrum of humanity. There so much we can accomplish together with more open technology.

      “The wager, I think, has been that professionalization will save the humanities
      from budgetary chopping blocks. Protected by our journals, societies, ladders
      of recognition, protocols of research, and regulated hot topics, we imagine
      a security that would not be available if we bucked these conventions and
      renewed the purposes that make humanistic inquiry legible, attractive, and
      compelling to a (buying) public”
