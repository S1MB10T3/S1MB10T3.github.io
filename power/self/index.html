    Our smart phones and computers are almost extensions to the human body. We to be able to read your boss’s emails, message your significant other, venture to new worlds in video games, and access a vast library of media. To be a part of western society and have no interaction with a computer of sorts is a fool’s gambit.

      Yet most of us don't understand how it works. The kids that are growing up with tablets maybe never know how it works because we lock the inner workings. Curious minds have to seek outside professionals to help them understand how a computer is able to run their favorite video games or how a tweet got sent from their phones and appeared on their friend's device.

      If users could edit their programs and apps to tailor them to their own lifestyle, why shouldn't they? Because it's not in the interest of the Adobe, Microsoft, or Apple. Even though we pay for these applications and laptop,s the creator still and always will have control over you. You have no say other than to not pay for the product on how it should function.

      “The technological process itself furnishes no justification for such a collectivism.
      Technics hampers individual development only insofar as they are tied to a social
      apparatus which perpetuates scarcity, and this same apparatus has released
      forces which may shatter the special historical form in which technics is utilized.” - Marcuse

      “’Free software’ means software that respects users'
      freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to
      run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, ‘free
      software’ is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you
      should think of ‘free’ as in ‘free speech,’ not as in ’free beer’. ” - Richard Stallmen
