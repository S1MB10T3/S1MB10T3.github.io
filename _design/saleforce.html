  <h2>The Process</h2>
  <div>
    <h3>Moodboard</h3>
    <p>
      I created a moodboard to go over during the first design meeting with Salesforce.
      This moodboard covered possible style and design choices like character aesthetics
      and rough mockups to showcase possible design solutions for activities.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the 1st draft of the simulation architecture, I created a User Flow to
      plan out the path and gameplay for the players. I sadly no longer have access
      to the a copy of the User Flow used for this project.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
    <p>
      I created low-fidelity Wireframes to flesh out the UX of the simulation.
      This was to give the clients an early rough insight to the the gameplay,
      as well as to allow for open feedback.
    </p>

      <img class="mid-img" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/salesforce/wireframes/l2.png" alt="wireframes">
    </div>
    <p>
      After all kinks were worked out with the low-fidelity Wireframes, I then
      created higher-fidelity Wireframes to move the designs closer to the final
      product, and to align the UI to Salesforce’s Lighting Design.

    <h3> Style </h3>
    <p class="center">
      We used Salesforce's branding color scheme to keep the look and feel of the
      game consistent with Salesforce as a brand.

    <h3>Layout</h3>
    <h4>Cards</h4>
    <p>
      Cards were chosen to keep consistency with Salesforce's own platform design.
      Additionally, minor, easy-to-develop animations were added to Cards for a
      more engaging user experience.

    <h4>Activities</h4>
    <p>
      Inpactful gameplay choices would happen on the Decisions Page, where users face game
      prompts and challenges and choose answers from a preselected list. These
      prompts and challenges all pertain to a fictional company named Allin.
    <video class="center" autoplay playsinline loop muted>
      <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/video/salesforce/challenges.webm" type="video/webm" >
      <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/video/salesforce/challenges.mp4" type="video/mp4" >
    </video>
    <p>
      In one scenario, the player needs to pitch Allin's services to a potential
      client company. The player is shown a number of potential challenges the
      potential client faces that perhaps Allin can solve. Players can drag and
      drop their top 4 solvable challenges into their answer to complete the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another scenario, the player "interviews" Allin Employee NPCs by choosing
      one of several predefined question categories, followed by a question from
      a predefined list. The NPC can either respond with helpful insight to the
      question, point the player in to the right person to ask, or provide a
      non-response.

    <h4>Metrics</h4>
    <p>
      Teams are able to keep track of their Key Performance Indicators on the KPI
      page. This page allows a player see how well they doing and get feedback on
      prior decisions through intuitive charts. They’re also able to check how
      much total knowledge they’ve unlocked through the game through the Knowledge
      Page.
