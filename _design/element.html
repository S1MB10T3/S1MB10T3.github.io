  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Element Finance is a protocol for fixed and variable yield markets. It is a
    decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to deposit assets
    and earn interest on their deposits. The protocol is built on the Ethereum
    blockchain and is governed by the Element DAO.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was brought on to Element as a Design Systems Designer to build out the
    new design system for the Element Finance v2 DAPP and the web3 community
    over all. My position grew to also ideate on the new branding for Element
    DAO, Element Foundation, and <s>[REDACTED]</s>.

      This work is basically scrapped but I'm still proud of it so I'm leaving
      it here on my portfolio.

  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <p>
    To create a concise and clear communication of the effects of the governance
    launch, and the three entities that is Element. Building a distinction
    between the R&D arm <s>[REDACTED]</s>, the Foundation and DAO, as the team
    innovates and build V2.
  </p>
  <p>
    Communicating a more clean, modern, and minimalist look that conserves the
    current logo and some elements of the current branding.

    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        As for any branding project, we started with a moodboard drawing from a
        wide range of different media.
      </p>
    </div>
  </span>

  <h3>Story</h3>

  <p>
    A goal early on for the new Brand was to have a connected lore/story to the
    older brand. We came up with the narrative that everyone(i.e. the users)
    wake up in a laboratory similar to Oz Corp. "The world of elves (the
    previous NFT project/branding) was all just a simulation." In this universe
    the world is governed by 3 elemental forces.
  </p>

  <h3>Concepts</h3>

      />
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4><s>[REDACTED]</s></h4>
      <p>
        Based on the elemental/alchemical Force of Fire. The
        <s>[REDACTED]</s> entity was design to present the ethos of break stuff
        and make stuff. Embracing the anonymous collective of the team to build
        and experiment. The concept of outer worldly, anonymous, and ghostly
        combined with the mad scientist in their lab.
      </p>
    </div>
  </span>
  <span class="horizontal-wrapper">
    <div>
      <h4>Element DAO</h4>
      <p>
        Like the alchemical element of Earth, the DAO represents the foundation
        and lifeblood for the Element Protocol. Inspired from video games and
        retro computing, the concept for the DAO's branding was to establish the
        community in cyberpunk city.

    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Element Foundation</h4>
      <p>
        The Element of Water represents knowledge in western alchemy. The
        Foundation is the legal owner of Elements IP and the contracted
        <s>[REDACTED]</s> and other entities to work on the Element Protocol.

  <h2>Design System</h2>

  <p>
    The goal for the design system was to set an industry standard. It can serve
    as an educational tool and reference for junior-level designers and content
    contributors in crypto. Explicitly written design systems that span across
    products, channels and departments aid those who are new to design in our
    industry and also serve as a reminder for the rest of the contributors.
  </p>

  <h3>Inspo</h3>
  <p>
    The visual aesthetic for the design system is a call back to early
    computing/tech. As well as pulling inspo from 50's/60's graphic design.
  </p>

    alt=""

  <h3>Guidelines</h3>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/element/Guidelines.png" alt="" />
  <p>
    Rules and suggestions are sometimes more important than the values presented
    for a design system. Making sure that fellow designers and developers can
    understand how to use the given text, colors, spacing, etc will help keep
    designs constant across different pages and applications.
  </p>

  <h3>Color</h3>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/element/Colors.png" alt="" />
  <span class="horizontal-wrapper">
    <div>
      <p>
        The colors where inspired by alchemy manuscripts primarily "Splendor
        Solis" by Salomon Trismosin. Each of the colors are named after an
        alchemical reagent or element. Such as Element Salt for White and
        Element Mercurius for Red.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <img
        src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/element/Solis.png"
        alt="Imaages of illustrastions from Splendor Solis"
      />
    </div>
  </span>

  <span class="horizontal-wrapper">
    <div>
      <img
        src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/element/color test.png"
        alt="buttons!!!"
      />
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>Color Blocked</h4>
      <p>
        Each of the colors chosen for the theme are at least AA WCAG compliant
        as long as they used for their intended roles. So all Accent, Text, and
        State colors have a strong contrast will all available Foreground and
        Background options for their respective theme.
      </p>
      <p>
        All colors have been tested per theme to make sure they look good
        anywhere they are meant to be applied!
      </p>
    </div>
  </span>

  <h3>Typography</h3>
  <p>
    The Base body text size (16px) is 1rem. So the next step up to LG(18px) is
    1.25rem and a step-down (14px) would be 0.75rem. This scaling also applies
    to all text accross the system.
  </p>
  <img
    src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/element/Type.png"
    alt="Screen shot of Moodboard"
  />
  <p>
    Headings use the Primary Text color and should have a line that's 1px width
    and 100px length. The line rest at the bottom of the heading. To make sure
    there's always strong visual contrast between the body text and the heading
    above, especially when using smaller headings such as Heading 6, as shown
    above, were the text size is the same as the body.
  </p>

    src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/element/Fonts.png"

  <h3>Components</h3>
  <img
    src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/element/Buttons.png"
    alt="buttons!!!"
  />
  <span class="horizontal-wrapper">
    <div>
      <img
        src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/element/figma components.png"
        alt="Figma"
      />
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The components had to be easy, varied, and composable for the other
        designers on the team. The designers can basically drag and drop then
        flip some switches to get the style, color, and size for components in a
        fly. The system made it so our UI designer can rapidly and reliably
        create and change pages faster and with high quality. Figma's component
        system is a great tool for this. It allows for crazy amount of
        properties and inputs as long as it was design right from the start.
      </p>
      <p>
        Figma's auto layout feature is a must-use for any components. This way
        scaling basically is a non factor and makes it really easy for frontend
        developers to translate it to code.

  <h2>UI</h2>
  <img

    alt="Two design mockups of Ui"
  />

  <p>
    I guess now it's probably the time to talk about V2... Element V1 solely
    offers fixed rates positions. In V2 we were creating an incentive system,
    and positioning ourselves as a yield protocol with variable rate products,
    leveraged rate products and colaterization and want to create a design
    system that visually communicates this experimentation and innovation.
  </p>

  <h3>Breaking The System!</h3>
  <img
    src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/element/Testing Zone.png"
    alt="buttons!!!"
  />
  <p>
    While I was mainly working on the design system, I was important to me to
    work on the UI mockups to test out the components and design Guidelines to
    see if I need to make any changes to the rules written or any redesigns to
    make sure everything works together.
  </p>

  <h3>New User Experience</h3>
  <img
    src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/element/temp.png"
    alt="Imaages of illustrastions from Splendor Solis"
  />
  <p>
    About the new user experience/education flow. How can we bring a non crypto
    users into defi. Will add a video/gif of the New User Flow!

  <h2>Postmortem</h2>
  <p>
    Even though my stay at Element was short is it was one of the best
    experiences I've had as a Designer. I was given space to actually have room
    to be creative and try new things. Also, just being able to work with a
    great team of extremely talented and smart people who were all very
    passionate about what they were doing.
    <b> Shout out to Tina! Best Boss Ever! </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    An aspect of the work I regret is not putting enough time into looking into
    more up incoming dapps/defi apps in the space. This would have helped to
    stand out in a sea of new defi protocols. While the designs were unique
    compared to dapps that we're already establish, I guess I was following a
    trend in design without realizing it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another issue was with the branding. I rushed in to making concepts without
    the proper research and planning. I should have taken more time to talk to
    shareholders and members of element to get a better feel of what they
    want/view Element as. In full honesty I wasn't excepting the stakeholders
    and the rest of the team to even take the concepts. Those designs were me
    playing around with ideas discussed in our design team brand ideation
    meetings.
