  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Element Finance is a protocol for fixed and variable yield markets. It is a
    decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to deposit assets
    and earn interest on their deposits. The protocol is built on the Ethereum
    blockchain and is governed by the Element DAO.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was brought on to Element as a Design Systems Designer to build out the a
    new design system for the Element Finance v2 DAPP and the web3 community
    over all. My position grew to also indiate on the new branding for Element
    DAO, Element Foundation, and <s>[REDACTED]</s>.

  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <p>
    To create a concise and clear communication of the effects of the governance
    launch, and the three entities that Element is comprised of. Building a
    distinction between the R&D arm <s>[REDACTED]</s>, the Foundation and DAO,
    as the team innovates and build V2.
  </p>
  <p>
    Communicating a more clean, modern, and minimalistic look that conserves the
    current logo and some elements of the current branding.

  <h2>Design System</h2>

  <p>
    The goal for the design system was to set an industry standard. It can serve
    as an educational tool and reference for junior-level designers and content
    contributors in crypto. Explicitly written design systems that span across
    products, channels and departments aid those who are new to design in our
    industry and also serve as a reminder for the rest of the contributors.
  </p>

  <h3>Inspo</h3>
  <p>
    The visual aesthetic for the design system is a call back to early
    computing/tech. As well as pulling inspo from 50's/60's graphic design.
  </p>

  <h3>Guidelines</h3>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/element/Guidelines.png" alt="" />
  <p>
    Rules and suggestions are sometimes more important then the values presented
    for a design system. Making sure that fellow designers and developers can
    understand how to use the given text, colors, spacing, and etc< will help
    keep designs consetant across different pages and applications.
  </p>

  <h3>Color</h3>

      />
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>Color Blocked</h4>
      <p>
        Each of the colors chosen for the theme are at least AA WCAG compliant
        as long as they used for their inteaded roles. So all Accent, Text, and
        State colors have a strong contrast will all avaible Foreground and
        Background options for their repective theme.
      </p>
      <p>
        All colors have been tested per theme to make sure they look good
        anywhere they are meant to be applied!
      </p>
    </div>
  </span>

  <h3>Typography</h3>
  <p>
    The Base body text size (16px) is 1rem. So the next step up to LG(18px) is
    1.25rem and a step down (14px) would be 0.75rem. This scaling also applies
    to all text accross the system.
  </p>
  <img
    src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/element/Type.png"
    alt="Screen shot of Moodboard"
  />
  <p>
    Headings use the Primary Text color and should have a line that's 1px width
    and 100px length. The line rest at the botton of the heading. To make sure
    there's always strong visual contrast between the body text and the heading
    above, especially when using smaller headings such as Heading 6, as shown
    above, were the text size is the same as the body.
  </p>

  <h3>Components</h3>

        alt="Figma"
      />
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The components had to be easy, varied, and composiable for the other
        designers on the team. This designers can basically drap and drop then
        flip some switchs to get the style, color, and size for compoenets in a
        fly. The system made it so our UI designer can rapidly and realibliy
        create and change pages faster and with high quaility. Figma's component
        system is a great tool for this. It allows for crazy amount of
        properties and inputs as long as it was design right from the start.
      </p>
      <p>
        Figma's auto layout feature is a must use for any compoenets. This way
        scaling basically is a non factor and makes it really easy for frontend
        developers to transalte it to code.

  <p>Short text about my role in the UI Design.</p>

  <p>
    I guess now it's probly the time to talk about V2... Element V1 solely
    offers fixed rates positions. In V2 we were creating an incentive system,
    and positioning ourselves as a yield protocol with variable rate products,
    leveraged rate products and collaterization and want to create a design
    system that visually communicates this experimentation and innovation.

  <h2>Post Mordem</h2>
  <p>
    Even though my stay at Element was short is it was one of the best
    experiences I've had as a Designer. I was given space
  </p>
  <p>
    An aspect of the work I regret is not putting enough time into looking into
    more upincoming dapps/defi apps in the space. This would have helped to
    stand out in a sea of new defi protocals. While the designs were unique
    compared to dapps that we're already establish, I guess I was following a
    treand in design without releazing it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another issue was with the branding. I rushed in to making concepts without
    the proper research and planning. I should have taken more time to talk to
    shareholders and members of elemennt to get a better feel of what they
    want/view Elemenet as. In full honesty I wasn't excepting the skateholders
    to even take the concepts graphics. Those designs were me plauing around
    with ideas dicussed in our design team brand ideaition meetings.
