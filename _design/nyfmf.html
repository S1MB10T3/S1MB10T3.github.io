  <div class="">
    <h3> Understanding the Brand </h3>
    <p>
      New York Film & Music Foundation is a nonprofit accelerator geared towards
      helping artists find success. NYFMF's goal is to allow artists to share their
      stories and connect with a broader audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began my work with NYFMF by hosting a workshop on basic design concepts,
      design thinking, market research, and brand identity. The purpose of this
      was twofold. Firstly, this would equip the team with the knowledge to keep
      building their branding and visual strategy independently. Secondly, it would
      build understanding as to why a redesign effort was needed, as the existing
      branding strategy was not cohesive.
    </p>

    <h3> Research </h3>
    <p>
      Two weeks before the workshop I asked the team to provide websites that they
      like the visual and functional aesthetics of from the nonprofit and music/media
      sectors. During the kickoff meeting I presented a few of these websites and
      a couple of websites of my own choosing and ran an exercise on what aspects
      of the website did they like and dislike.
    </p>

    </div>

    <h4> Previous Brand </h4>
    <p>
      I interviewed the members of the organization on their feelings toward
      current brand, particularly the logo.
    </p>

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/old-logo.jpg" alt="Old NYFMF Logo">

    <p>
      Through these interviews, I found that a number of people found the logo
      difficult to read and confusing, making it a significant pain point and a
      good starting point in the redesign effort.
    </p>

    <h4> Previous Site </h4>

      <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/video/nyfmf/nyfmf-old.webm" type="video/webm" >
      <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/video/nyfmf/nyfmf-old.mp4" type="video/mp4" >
    </video>

    <p>
      Through these user interviews, I discovered that the non-development team
      found it difficult to add or change information on the page, making it a
      significant hindrance to update the artist roster, for instance. However,
      the website's tech stack (Express.js and Jade) did make it easier to code
      for a developer, meaning this would be a tradeoff we would have to weigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, I found that the single-page layout was not the friendliest
      to an end user, as the page showcased a significant amount of information
      that was overwhelming put on a singular page and required a significant
      amount of scrolling to get through.

  <h2> The Process </h2>

  <h3> Wireframes </h3>

  </div>

  <p>
    Due to time constraints, I dove straight into the design/brand identity creation
    process after making the initial wireframes. This is definitely not something
    I'd ideally like to do--I normally create numerous drafts and iterate to
    improve those designs based on client feedback.

  <h2> The Results </h2>
  <div class="">
    <h3> Brand Redesign </h3>
    <h4> Logo </h4>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/full-logo.png" alt="" />

    <p>
      While designing the new logo, I kept in mind the brand attributes we had
      come up with in the initial meeting. This the new Logo instills a feeling
      of "Modern" and "Established," and uses the type <b>Lemon Milk</b> by
      <a href="https://marsnev.com/">Marsnev</a>.
    </p>

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/logo-bw.png" alt="Black and White Logos" />

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/logo.png" alt="" />

    <p>
      The logo was kept greyscale to render well and consistently across different
      media like film, print, and web. The use of different shades of gray kept
      the logo feeling dynamic and modern.
    </p>

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/mark-images.png" alt="" />

    <p>
      Above is a concept of how the logo can be used in promotional material.
      These design concept was inspired by the MTV logo, where a logo can be
      manipulated but still be immediately recognizable as the logo."
    </p>

    <h4> Color </h4>
    <p>
      When discussing colors with the team, I came to the conclusion that keeping
      black and white allows for the images and film to breathe more without worry
      of clash.
    </p>
    <h4> Typography </h4>

    <div>
      <p>Lemon Milk - Logo</p>
      <p>Neue Haas Unica W1G - Headings</p>
      <p>Cooper Hewitt - Body</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      I chose three fonts for the visual strategy, wanting to keep things simple.
      A sans serif font was chosen for a more youthful feel, reflecting the artists
      the foundation represents.
    </p>

    <h3> Website Redesign </h3>

      <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/video/nyfmf/home.mp4" type="video/mp4" >
    </video>

    <p>
      Homepage displays the most recent Deep Dive Sessions on the top via a carousel,
      which are "blog post"/articles about an Artist involved in NYFMF. The homepage
      design accomplishes the same needed info about the organization in a cleaner
      format while also leading towards other pages on the site for more details.
    </p>

      <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/video/nyfmf/story.webm" type="video/webm" >
      <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/video/nyfmf/story.mp4" type="video/mp4" >

    </video>


    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/artist-profile.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      In the original wireframes, I had a place for artist content. Instead I opted
      for having links to external sites for artist content. Since the organization
      isn't a publishing company and all the artists that are supported are creating
      and publishing on their own, it would be easy for development and for the
      artists to have users of the site go to their Youtube channels or Soundcloud
      profiles. This way we wouldn't need to build a publishing platform on the
      site.
    </p>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/donate.png" alt="" />

    <p>
      An actual donation page. In terms of the rest of the donation process, i.e.
      name and email, that's to be planned once the choice of donation platform
      is solidified.
