    <h2> Understanding the Brand </h2>
    <p>
      When I brought on to work on New York Film Foundation's I hosted a workshop
      on basic design, design thinking, market research, and brand identity. The
      goal was to make sure that the team have a good base for when I leave to take
      over the and run the site. Also do to a lack of any design launge or style
      guide, graphics and messaging on social media was all over the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the Brand Identity portion of the workshop I went over the what is
      and makes up a brand. With the team, we came up with a handful of brand
      attributes to help guide me and the rest of the organization.

    <h2> Research </h2>
    <p>
      Two weeks before the workshop I asked the team to provide websites that they
      like the visual and funcational aesthetics of from the nonprofit and music/media
      sectors. During the kickoff meeting I presented a few of these websites and
      a couple of websites of my own chosing and ran a excirse on what apsects of
      the website did they like and dislike.

    <h3> Current Brand </h3>
    <p>
      Along with all the research for building a new site, I also conducted interviews
      with the team members and friends on the current brand and in patucalur the
      logo.

      While I could understand where the original designer was going for with a FM
      logo, the way it was exucited makes it look more like a FN or a FA to mulputlie
      people both within the team and non designer friends.
