<!-- Intro -->

  <p id="blurb">
    New York Film & Music Foundation is a nonprofit accelerator geared toward helping
    artists find success. NYFMF goal is to help artists tell their stories to a
    broader audience, and connect them to a community that appreciates the arts.

  <h1> The Start </h1>
  <div class="">
    <h2> Understanding the Brand </h2>
    <p>
      When I brought on to work at New York Film Foundation's I hosted a workshop
      on basic design, design thinking, market research, and brand identity. The
      goal was to make sure that the team has a good base for when I leave to take
      over and run the site. Also due to a lack of any design language or style
      guide, graphics and messaging on social media was all over the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the Brand Identity portion of the workshop I went over the what is
      and makes up a brand. With the team, we came up with a handful of brand
      attributes to help guide me and the rest of the organization.
    </p>

  <div class="">
    <h2> Research </h2>
    <p>
      Two weeks before the workshop I asked the team to provide websites that they
      like the visual and functional aesthetics of from the nonprofit and music/media
      sectors. During the kickoff meeting I presented a few of these websites and
      a couple of websites of my own choosing and ran an exercise on what aspects
      of the website did they like and dislike.
    </p>

    <div class="center">
      <img class="mid-img" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/userprofile-1.png" alt="" />
      <img class="mid-img" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/userprofile-2.png" alt="" />
      <img class="mid-img" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/userprofile-3.png" alt="" />
      <img class="mid-img" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/userprofile-4.png" alt="" />
    </div>

    <h3> Previous Brand </h3>
    <p>
      Along with all the research for building a new site, I also conducted interviews
      with the team members and friends on the current brand and in particular the
      logo.
    </p>

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/old-logo.jpg" alt="Old NYFMF Logo">

    <p>
      While I could understand where the original designer was going with a FM
      logo, the way it was executed makes it look more like a FN or a FA to mulputlie
      people both within the team and non designer friends. I do like the choice
      of helvetica, since it's the typeface found on every corner and tunnel in
      NYC.
    </p>

    <h3> Previous Site </h3>

    <video class="center" autoplay playsinline loop muted>
      <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/video/nyfmf/nyfmf-old.webm" type="video/webm" >
      <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/video/nyfmf/nyfmf-old.mp4" type="video/mp4" >
    </video>

    <p>
      While the aesthetics of the site can be argued for, the functionality of it
      for the team is lacking. The site was built with Express.js and Jade, while
      easy for a coder to manage, quite difficult for someone on the social media
      team to update info on the site or change the roster of artists. Another
      issue is the one page layout.
    </p>
    <p>
      While mainly organizations can get away if a one page site, NYFMF and many
      nonprofits have to showcase more information to showcase value then what can
      fit on a one page layout.

<!-- Drafting/Process -->
<section id="2">
  <h1> The Process </h1>

  <h2> Wireframes </h2>
  <div class="center">
    <img class="small-img" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/about-wireframe.png" alt="" />
    <img class="small-img" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/home-wireframe.png" alt="" />
    <img class="small-img" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/profile-wireframe.png" alt="" />
  </div>

  <div class="center">
    <img class="small-img" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/about-xd-wireframe.png" alt="" />
    <img class="small-img" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/home-xd-wireframe.png" alt="" />
    <img class="small-img" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/profile-xd-wireframe.png" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>
    This time around, I tried out a new process in the design creation. After
    creating the wireframes, I went straight into creating a design/brand identity
    for NYFMF.
  </p>
  <p>
    Something I won't repeat again is creating a brand identity in one shot without
    drafts for the client to choose between. But due to a lack of time I decided
    to go with a single identity draft to present.
  </p>

<!-- Final/Results -->
<section id="2">
  <h1> The Results </h1>
  <div class="">
    <h2> Brand Redesign </h2>
    <h3> Logo </h3>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/full-logo.png" alt="" />

    <p>
      With the goal of using the brand attributes as presented earlier in the case
      study, the new Logo hopefully instills a "Modern" and "Establish" feeling
      with the type choice of<b>Lemon Milk</b> by <a href="https://marsnev.com/">Marsnev</a>.
    </p>

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/logo-bw.png" alt="Black and White Logos" />

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/logo.png" alt="" />

    <p>
      The goal of the new logo mark wasn't to be extremely iconic, but more serves
      a functional purpose to fit different needs in film and graphics. By default
      it uses different shades of grey to keep it dynamatic.
    </p>

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/mark-images.png" alt="" />

    <p>
      A concept of how the logo can be used in graphics such as posters or promotional
      material! Inspired by the MTV logo, a system where a logo can be manipulated
      around and still hold on its own is something I try to build towards.
    </p>

    <h3> Color </h3>
    <p>
      When discussing colors with the team, I came to the conclusion that keeping
      black and white allows for the images and film to breathe more without worry
      of clash.
    </p>
    <h3> Typography </h3>

    <div>
      <p>Lemon Milk - Logo</p>
      <p>Neue Haas Unica W1G - Headings</p>
      <p>Cooper Hewitt - Body</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      This time around I tried to keep things simple with the type. Focusing on
      just two fonts choices, three if you count the logo.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have conquered using a serif font for the body but will be looking for a
      professional. I think using a san-serif like Cooper Hewitt suits the branding
      a bit more since the organization is pretty new and isn't trying to be "elities"
      or "high end".
    </p>
  </div>

    <h2> Website Redesign </h2>

      <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/video/nyfmf/home.mp4" type="video/mp4" >
    </video>

    <p>
      Homepage displays the most recent Deep Dive Sessions on the top via a carousel,
      which are "blog post"/articles about an Artist involved in NYFMF. The homepage
      design accomplishes the same needed info about the organization in a cleaner
      format while also leading towards other pages on the site for more details.
    </p>

    </video>


    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/artist-profile.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      In the original wireframes, I had a place for artist content. Instead I opted
      for having links to external sites for artist content. Since the organization
      isn't a publishing company and all the artists that are supported are creating
      and publishing on their own, it would be easy for development and for the
      artists to have users of the site go to their Youtube channels or Soundcloud
      profiles. This way we wouldn't need to build a publishing platform on the
      site.
    </p>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/nyfmf/donate.png" alt="" />

    <p>
      An actual donation page. In terms of the rest of the donation process, i.e.
      name and email, that's to be planned once the choice of donation platform
      is solidified.
