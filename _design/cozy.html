    <h2> It's something... </h2>
    <p>
      cozy.nyc is a ongoing project <a href="https://github.com/JimenezJC">Juan Jimenez</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/nobodyhere2see">Sophia Setsu</a>, and I are working on.
      The site was originally intended to be an online buying and selling marketplace,
      but its purpose has changed over time to be a platform for creatives, makers,
      and fans alike to discuss and share creative projects.

      <br />
      <br />

      We currently are working on the discussion board aspect of the site, a video
      streaming directory, and a featured works area where users can post updates
      for ongoing and finished projects.

    <h2>Stay Cozy...</h2>
    <p>
      Why the name "cozy?" When we first started on the project (back when we
      planned it to be am e-commerce site), A$AP Mob's *Cozy Tapes* just came out.
    </p>

  <h2> Logo - Cubes </h2>
  <div class="left">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cozy/cube.svg" alt="box-logo">
    <p class="center"><em> Designed by <a href="https://byronkim.myportfolio.com/">Byron Kim</a> </em></p>
  </div>
  <div class="right">
    <p>
      Why a cube? We wanted to have a logo that could be converted to a physical
      object, and a cube is a versatile and simple shape to reproduce using other
      media.

      <br />
      <br />

      The "C" on the side of the cube is a play on the fact that cozy's content
      is consumed on digital boxes like computer monitors and phones.

    <h2>Font - Dosis</h2>
    <p>
      Why Dosis? Dosis is a rounded, san-serif font. When considering how to give
      the site a warm, playful atmosphere, Dosis Extra Bold fits well and matches
      other design elements like our logo.
