    <h2> It's something... </h2>
    <p>
      cozy.nyc is an ongoing project <a href="https://github.com/JimenezJC">Juan Jimenez</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/nobodyhere2see">Sophia Setsu</a>, and I are working on.
      The project has gone through two conceptual pivots. We initially wanted to
      create an online buying and selling marketplace, but later changed strategy
      when we realized there was an oversaturated market in this sphere. As a result of
      this and shifting personal interests, we decided to instead create a platform
      for creatives and fans alike to share and discuss projects. Soon, we realized
      that this was too broad an idea for our small team to accomplish, and
      re-conceptualized cozy.nyc as a livestream platform for NYC creatives.

    <h3> New Goal </h3>
    <p>
        Our new goal with cozy.nyc is to build an open live streaming platform for NYC
        creatives to show finished work or the creative process.

  <h2> Brand Design </h2>

  <div class="left">
    <h3>Stay Cozy...</h3>
    <p>
      Why the name "cozy?" When we first started on the project (back when we
      planned it to be am e-commerce site), A$AP Mob's *Cozy Tapes* just came out.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3> Logo - Cubes </h3>
  <div class="left">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cozy/cube.svg" alt="box-logo">
    <p class="center"><em> Designed by <a href="https://byronkim.myportfolio.com/">Byron Kim</a> </em></p>
  </div>
  <div class="right">
    <p>
      Why a cube? We wanted to have a logo that could be converted to a physical
      object, and a cube is a versatile and simple shape to reproduce using other
      media.

      <br />
      <br />

      The "C" on the side of the cube is a play on the fact that cozy's content
      is consumed on digital boxes like computer monitors and phones.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="right">
    <h3>Font - Dosis</h3>
    <p>
      Why Dosis? Dosis is a rounded, san-serif font. When considering how to give
      the site a warm, playful atmosphere, Dosis Extra Bold fits well and matches
      other design elements like our logo.
    </p>

  <h2> The Old Web Design </h2>

  <p>
    Users can post live streams from websites like Twitch, Youtube, and Instagram
    to the directory and invite other users to the streaming platform's chat.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The goal is to have a community that can watch and discuss videos and streams
    together as they're happening, without having to move around different websites.
  </p>

  <h3> Wireframes </h3>

  <h3> Old Design Mockups </h3>

  </div>

  <p>
    One issue with the original cozy.nyc designs was that I attempted to combine
    too many colors. While every section of the site, i.e. streams, boards, etc,
    had their own color theme, the themes themselves did not work so much with the
    content displayed and the goals of the application.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the team is focused on just the livestreaming features of the site the
    old design did not have to hold to the same color theme rules.

  <h2> Redesign </h2>

  <h3> Home Page </h3>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cozy/designs/new/home.png" alt="color-cube">

  <p>
    The homepage/stream directory is now focused on displaying all current streams
    at the ease of a scroll. A recent capture of the stream is displayed and info
    such as the name, user, and views of the view is hidden until hovered. This
    hopefully will put the content front and center rather than the views and whos
    hosting the stream.
  </p>

  <p>
    The order and size of the stream preview is based on views for now until a
    better solution in order to get more people on to unheard artists is found.
  </p>


  <h3> Stream </h3>

  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cozy/designs/new/stream-fullscreen.png" alt="color-cube">

  <p>
    A global chat is still kept for a sense of community amongst the site. There's
    also a local/profile chat if a user allows it on their stream along with support
    for 3rd Party chats from other platforms the video stream is taking place.
 </p>

  <div class="center">
    <video class="center" autoplay playsinline loop muted>
      <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/video/cozy/cozy-profile.webm" type="video/webm" >
      <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/video/cozy/cozy-profile.mp4" type="video/mp4" >
    </video>
  </div>

  <p>
    A simple profile to get users on to other platforms to support artists. The
    goal is not trying to be the next big platform for artists. It's just a place
    to share content across a community big or small.
