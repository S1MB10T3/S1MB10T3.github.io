    <h1> It's something... </h1>
    <p>
      cozy.nyc is a ongoing project <a href="https://github.com/JimenezJC">Juan Jimenez</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/nobodyhere2see">Sophia Setsu</a>, and I are working on.
      The site was originally intended to be an online buying and selling marketplace to
      a platform for creatives, makers, and fans alike to discuss and share creative
      projects. Now it's just a livestream platform focused for creatives in NYC.

      <br />
      <br />

      You can read more about the road of failures on cozy on my blog
      <a href="/blog/2021/03/05/old-cozy.html"> here</a>.
    </p>

    <h2> New Goal </h2>
    <p>
        Our new goal with cozy.nyc is to build a open livestreaming platform for NYC
        creatives to show finished work or the creative procress.

<h1> Brand Design </h1>

    <h2>Stay Cozy...</h2>
    <p>
      Why the name "cozy?" When we first started on the project (back when we
      planned it to be am e-commerce site), A$AP Mob's *Cozy Tapes* just came out.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2> Logo - Cubes </h2>
  <div class="left">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cozy/cube.svg" alt="box-logo">
    <p class="center"><em> Designed by <a href="https://byronkim.myportfolio.com/">Byron Kim</a> </em></p>
  </div>
  <div class="right">
    <p>
      Why a cube? We wanted to have a logo that could be converted to a physical
      object, and a cube is a versatile and simple shape to reproduce using other
      media.

      <br />
      <br />

      The "C" on the side of the cube is a play on the fact that cozy's content
      is consumed on digital boxes like computer monitors and phones.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="right">
    <h2>Font - Dosis</h2>
    <p>
      Why Dosis? Dosis is a rounded, san-serif font. When considering how to give
      the site a warm, playful atmosphere, Dosis Extra Bold fits well and matches
      other design elements like our logo.

  <h1> The Old Web Design </h1>

  <p>
    Users can post livestreams from websites like Twitch, Youtube, and Instagram
    to the directory and invite other users to the streaming platform's chat.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The goal is to have a community that can watch and discuss videos and streams
    together as they're happening, without having to move around different websites.
  </p>

  <h2> Wireframes </h2>

    <img class="mid-img"  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cozy/wireframes/stream.png" alt="stream page wireframe">

  <h2> Old Design Mockups </h2>

  </div>

  <p>
    One issue with the original cozy.nyc designs was that I attemped to combine
    to many colors. While every section of the site, i.e. streams, boards, etc,
    had their own color theme, the themes themselves did not work so much with
    the content diplayed and the goals of the application.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the team is focused on just the livestreaming features of the site the
    old design did not have to hold to the same color theme rules.

  <h1> Redesign </h1>

  <h2> Home Page </h2>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cozy/designs/new/home.png" alt="color-cube">

  <p>
    The homepage/stream directory is now focued on displaying all current streams
    at the ease of a scroll. A recent caputure of the stream is displayed and info
    such as the name, user, and views of the view is hidden until hovered. This
    hopefully will put the content front and center rather then the views and whos
    hosting the stream.
  </p>

  <p>
    The order and size of the stream preview is based on views for now until a better
    solution of order to get more people on to unheard artist is found.
  </p>


  <h2> Stream </h2>

  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/cozy/designs/new/stream-fullscreen.png" alt="color-cube">

  <p>
    A global chat is still kept for a sense of community amongst the site. There's
    also a local/profile chat if a user allows it on their stream along with support
    for 3rd Party chats from other platforms the video stream is taking place.
 </p>

  <div class="center">
    <video class="center" autoplay playsinline loop muted>
      <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/video/cozy/cozy-profile.webm" type="video/webm" >
      <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/video/cozy/cozy-profile.mp4" type="video/mp4" >
    </video>
  </div>

  <p>
    A simple profile to get users on to other platforms to support artist. The goal
    is not trying to be the next big platform for artist. It's just a place to share
    content across a community big or small.
