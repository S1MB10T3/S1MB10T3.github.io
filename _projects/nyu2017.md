This was my first hackathon and also my first attempt in using express to
build a website.

Townhall was meant to be a site for people to find out about who their local representatives are, their polices they advocate for, and voting dates/locations.

The project fell flat mostly because we pick a technology that only one of us on the team knew how to use(and also did not contribute to the coding) and the fact that a similar website already exist with the same name.
