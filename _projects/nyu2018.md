OpenUni is a project that I'm still interested in working on in the future.
The goal for the site is to provide videos, textbooks, and notes for free for
anyone. Users can upload/link media that they find informative/educational.

For the hackathon we focused on getting streaming and video sharing down. We did
this by using [Rustla2](https://github.com/MemeLabs/Rustla2) by
[MemeLabs](https://github.com/MemeLabs) because its a MIT licensed livestream
site that [strims.gg](https://strims.gg) uses.

Ran into a couple of problems using this as a code base. The documentation isn't
that good, especially for running the site. I thought I figured it out and even
made a pull requests with the changes in the documentation, but those instructions
did seem to work anymore by the time the hackathon came along.
