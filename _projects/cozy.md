A site for neets...
### [cozy.nyc](https://cozy.nyc) is still in progress

## It's something...
cozy.nyc is just a site me and my friend [Juan Jimenez](https://github.com/JimenezJC)
are working on to build our web development skills.

The site planned features are a messaging board, a video streaming platform, and an e-commerce
site.
