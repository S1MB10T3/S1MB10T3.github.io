How bullshit is your startup?

[Git Repo](https://github.com/S1MB10T3/bullshit)

Originally we planned to do something with Ethereum during this hackathon but
it proved to be a lot harder to learn how develop a DApp than we thought. So
we pivoted on the last couple of hours to this...

Bullsh!t is a webapp that reads a website, an about/splash page is recommend,
and scores the site based on the number of tech "buzzwords" that pop up.

Right now the app uses a word bank of "buzzwords" that we thought of in the
moment, but if we had the time training a natural language processor would be
ideal, so it would improve by usage with the assistance of human/user input of
their own rating/review.
