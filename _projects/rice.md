# Design

## In Theory
When thinking of the design of the rice, I thought of the Apple in the 80's. Their
cream chassis Macintosh with the hit of color on the Apple logo.

## Process

_Background by Ilya Kuvshinov_

When picking colors for my rice I started out with a cream color and then from there
work around a background that had a color palette that I wanted to go for.

While looking for themes for Atom, Chrome, and other applications I came across
The color palette/theme Solarized, created by Ethan Schoonover, was a prefect set
of background and foreground colors.
