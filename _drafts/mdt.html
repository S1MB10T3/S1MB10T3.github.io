  <h2>Early Draft</h2>
  <div class="">
    <p>
      Made a quick mock up of a potential simulation design for Facebook Management
      Team. Since we were still figuring out the right approach to what learning
      points we are trying to hit. Hybrid work is a new world and there’s no one
      set of answers to teach Managers to run they teams when they’re split across
      buildings, homes, and timezones.

    <p>
      Started off building out screens that are useful for possible management scenarios
      like a Dashboard to view your team, Calendar for planning meetings, and a Video
      Chat screen for meetings.

      A detailed view of the player NPC team members. Providing a current emotional
      state and some KPI details.

  <h2>Final Desgin</h2>
  <p>
    An issue with the early prototype was a lack of gameplay direction. The
    notification bar provides a clear list of things that the player has to do as
    well as a historical list of actions taken throughout the simulation.

  </div>
  <p>
    In addition the dashboard has been changed to provide a map of where the players
    team members are located across the global, a list displaying all the NPC’s
    Pulse Results (a metric used internally at Meta), and an org chart.
  </p>

  <p>
    The character bio became a popup model making it easier to access and leave
    across the simulation on different pages.
  </p>

    The chat system has been pulled from Prior Facebook simulations. By clicking
    on message segments players can form a message which they can send. Based on
    the segments chosen the model will give a positive or negative response.

  <p>
    1 on 1 video calls displays the NPC’s Pulse Results and changes in real time
    based on the users response using the same chat system in the group chat. While
    group video calls requires the player to mark flags of instances negative traits
    and interactions during the meeting.
