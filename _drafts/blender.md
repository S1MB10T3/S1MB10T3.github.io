I need to go through the basics. Kinda released since I've been using blender
to build stuff I need for class or an art piece, I have never sat down and practice
this software.

I felt that most of my skills I've learned/honed have been through building something
I want to create first, but in reality I've always been taught general skills of
different mediums through a professor/teacher in school and have always prototype
and played around with materials before working on the main goal.

Blender is different. I feels like an art tool in the real world but because the
application can do so much and while I had professors for 3D graphics and design,
I have never been taught how to use Blender and all the tools it provides me.

I should get to the basics and start recreating house objects like mugs, pans, shoes,
and devices.
